          <h1>Camping</h1>
            <p>
            If you're looking for an opportunity to experience the beauty of Welsh countryside in its raw form, camping in Wales is a great way to do so.
            Wales has a lot to offer, from stunning coastlines to dramatic mountain scenery and ancient woodlands. 
            There are many campsites in Wales that offer a range of activities and amenities for a unique camping experience. 
            For instance, <a href="https://www.willowspringscampsite.co.uk" target="_blank" class="black-text">Willow Springs Campsite</a> is a small, eco-friendly campsite located in the Afan Forest Park in Neath Port Talbot, South Wales. 
            This valley is a popular spot for outdoor enthusiasts, mountain bikers, cyclists, and explorers. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Camping on <a href="http://www.campingonthefarm.co.uk" target="_blank" class="black-text">The Farm</a> is another great option for those looking for a relaxing break on the beautiful West Wales coast. 
            It is a small, family-run campsite located next to the sea and coastal path in Aberaeron. 
            It's just a 5-minute, pleasant, level walk away from the Georgian harbor town. 
            </p>
            <p>
            If you're planning to explore the coast path, there are several campsites along the route or close by that offer convenient 
            and affordable places to stay. Alternatively, you can choose a base in a bigger town or city like Tenby or St Davids and select shorter sections for day walks. 
            <a href="https://www.glan-y-mor.co.uk"  target="_blank" class="black-text">Glan-Y-Mor Camp Site</a> is a short walk from Britain's smallest city with spectacular views of St Brides Bay.
            It's also within easy walking distance of the Coastal Path for those who want to continue their journey on foot.
