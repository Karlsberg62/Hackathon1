                    From glamping pods to grand castles, there's something for everyone. For those who love the 
                    outdoors but don't want to rough it, glamping pods are a great option. These cozy wooden cabins
                    provide protection from the elements while still allowing guests to enjoy the beauty of the natural 
                    surroundings. YHA Manobier on the Pembrokeshire Coast, is an ideal place to enjoy a long 
                    weekend in a glamping pod.</p>

                    offering 12 acres of camping area and an additional 28 acres of oak woodland and open 
                    fields to explore and observe wildlife. For those who prefer the coastal path, the Bron-Y-
                    Wendon Holiday Park is just a 5-minute walk from the Coastal Path, making it an ideal stop 
                    for those wanting to explore the Northern West Wales Coastline.</p>

            <h1>Wild Camping</h1>
            <p>
              Wild camping is the term used for camping in natural or remote areas without designated campsites or facilities. It is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and experience nature, but it comes with some legal and ethical issues.
             In Wales, wild camping is not legally permitted except with the landowner's permission. However, some hikers and walkers who follow trails in Wales, such as the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path, may find that wild camping is tolerated in some places, provided they follow certain guidelines. These include camping in the same place for only one night, pitching the tent discreetly in a remote place that will not be easily seen, avoiding camping in or near settlements, farms, or cultivated land, and seeking permission from the landowner if possible. Additionally, they should leave no trace of the campsite, remove all rubbish and waste, put up the tent at dusk and take it down at dawn, and avoid making noise or fires. However, wild camping on beaches in Wales is not tolerated under any circumstances.
             If you are interested in wild camping in Wales, you should be aware of potential risks and challenges such as finding a suitable and safe spot to camp, avoiding trespassing or disturbing wildlife or livestock, dealing with unpredictable and harsh weather conditions, being prepared for emergencies or injuries, and respecting the local culture and customs while being courteous to other people you may encounter.
             Alternatively, consider staying in one of Wales's many official campsites, youth hostels, or touring caravan sites. These places offer a range of facilities and amenities, as well as an opportunity to explore the beautiful scenery and attractions of the country.
