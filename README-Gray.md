        [Logo 1](/assets/logo/Web%20capture_10-1-2024_165527__resized.jpeg)
        [Logo 2](/assets/logo/Web%20capture_10-1-2024_173633__resized.jpeg)

    Used a CSS file and HTML file to create it

    CSS file is in the assets folder in the CSS sub-folder which were used to generate logo
        files are logo.css and logo.css

    Images used are in the assests folder in the logo sub-folder
        files are Web%20capture_10-1-2024_165527__resized.jpeg (logo) and Web%20capture_10-1-2024_173633__resized.jpeg (logo2)
        
    HTML test harnesses used for the logos is in the main site folder
        files are logo.html and logo2.html

    Team decided on logo2

    Basic CSS to describe the shapes is from *[How TO - CSS Shapes](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shapes.asp)* but modified

    Used to image-editor.com to resize the image.
